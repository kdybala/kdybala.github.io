Dr. Kristen Dybala is a Principal Ecologist in the Pacific Coast and Central Valley Group of [Point Blue Conservation Science](https://www.pointblue.org), where she leads strategic research to inform conservation strategies that have multiple benefits for people and wildlife. Her work focuses on the restoration of riparian and wetland ecosystems in California's Central Valley and has included developing science-based conservation objectives for the [Central Valley Joint Venture](https://www.centralvalleyjointventure.org), a [framework](https://pointblue.github.io/DeltaMultipleBenefits) supporting Multiple-Benefit Conservation in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta, and a synthesis of the multiple benefits of wetland conservation. 

Dr. Dybala also directs Point Blue's [Palomarin Field Station](https://www.pointblue.org/about-us/contact-visit-us/), located in the Point Reyes National Seashore. Palomarin is the oldest, continuously-operating field bird banding station in the western United States, whose multiple 50+ year data sets provide [unique insights](https://www.pointblue.org/palodataexplorer) into bird responses to environmental change. It's also a premiere location for [early-career training](https://www.pointblue.org/internships/conservation-science-internships-at-the-palomarin-field-station/) in avian ecology, and a hub for regional conservation research and monitoring efforts, including Northern Spotted Owls and Snowy Plovers.
